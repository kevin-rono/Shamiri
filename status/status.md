#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have laid out the skeleton for the user's side of the website. I'm working on storing the data in a database that can be accessed from the administrators end.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't implemented a program to evaluate the user's data, and I haven't implemented an administrator's account that can access the user's data.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I've had trouble stroring the user's data in a database and implementing a program to evaluate the user's data; kind of grading the data.
I've also had trouble implementing an administrator's account that can access the user's data.
