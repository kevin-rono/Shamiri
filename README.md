# User Manual
The use of Shamiri's website is pretty straightforward.

Theme: Mental health

Background: Mental illness is a significant cause of the global health burden, especially for the youth. Unfortunately, most of the youth with mental illnesses do not receive treatment.
This is especially true for those in low and middle-income countries.

The goal of this website is to build upon a research and intervention on mental health in high school students I carried out in Kibera, a slum in Kenya.
It's a platform where after the user creates an account, it implements a metric, The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), that collects data in the form of
a 'survey' from the user to screen for the presence and severity of depression. This data is then stored in a database and later evaluated using a program in python to
determine the eligibility of the user to participate in the intervention-- this mainly invloves conditions since the data values are ints. In the intervention section, the
user will be taken through a short 3-section course on Growth Mindset, Gratitude, and Value Affirmation.

This intervention invovles an interactive platform where the user goes through the content and fills out different tasks. Their responses to the tasks will be recorded and
forwarded to the administrators for evaluation of progress and potential feedback. The administrators will have their own accounts from which they can view this information.

1. About

Before starting, the user should read the about us page to get a sense of what Shamiri is, what we do, and what they should expect.

2. Sign up and log in

Users use the sign up option to create an account in order to access the eligibility form and intervention page.
Administrators use the admin option to create an account in order to access the user's data and responses in the forms and answers pages.

3. Eligibility and intervention

Users fill out the eligibility form for the administrators to evaluate the levels of depression in the forms page. Although users can proceed straight to the
intervention, we advise them to wait for one of the admins to reach out to them via their emails so as to guide them through the intervention so as to tailor
the experience to their needs. The questions answered by the users during the intervention are evaluated by the administrators in the answers page.
