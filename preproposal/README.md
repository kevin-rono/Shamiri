# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A web-based application using JavaScript, Python, and SQL, based in part on Problem Set 8â€™s distribution code.

Context: Law/finance

Background:
In many countries, when drafting and negotiating a first draft for a facility agreement between borrowers(companies)
and lenders(banks), lawyers use what is called the LMA(Loan Market Association) boilerplate: a 200-page tempalte that ids tailored
to the loan in question.

Problem:
The problem is, lawyers spend weeks "filling in", in a formulaic fashion, the 200-page template by brute force:they add and omit
definitions where necessary fill in specific blanks where necessary (e.g: currency, date, time, monthly periods), note which parts need
further negotiation, etc.

Solution:
Create a website which (much like in survey) asks the user (client/lawyer) to provide a number of inputs (which will be prompted by
a series of questions) and, eventually, which will "spit out" a first draft of the facilities agreement.
