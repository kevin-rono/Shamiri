# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Shamiri

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that promotes mental health, wellness and resilience in the youth.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Theme: Mental health

Background: Mental illness is a significant cause of the global health burden, especially for the youth. Unfortunately, most of the youth
            with mental illnesses do not receive treatment. This is especially true for those in low and middle-income countries.

The goal of this website is to build upon a research and intervention on mental health in high school students I carried out in Kibera, a slum in Kenya.
It's a platform where after the user creates an account, it implements a metric, The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), that collects data in the
form of a 'survey' from the user to screen for the presence and severity of depression. This data is then stored in a database and later evaluated using
a program in python to determine the eligibility of the user to participate in the intervention-- this mainly invloves conditions since the data values are ints.
In the intervention section, the user will be taken through a short 3-section course on Growth Mindset, Gratitude, and Value Affirmation. This intervention
invovles an interactive platform where the user goes through the content and fills out different tasks. Their responses to the tasks will be recorded and forwarded
to the administrators for evaluation of progress and potential feedback. The administrators will have their own accounts from which they can view this information.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I can implement the website, making sure it collects and stores data, and evaluates the data to determine the eligibility of the user for the intervention.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can implement the intervention part of the website as well.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to acheive the goal of the website which is to evaluate the mental health state of the user, and convey it to an administrator who can further evaluate it and give feedback and
further guidance to the user.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step would be, coming with with a design for the website, and figure out the code to implement in order to acquire, store and evaluate the users data. I would need to learn how to
link the user and administrator accounts so that the administrator can review the user's data and provide feedback that the user can receive. I would need to research how to implement the metric used to
to screen for the presence and severity of depression in a web app. And how to implement the intervention as well. Just because this has to be a correct metric and a correct intervention.
